# ReCore Button Maker

## Why make this project?

This project is to help me learn and improve my react skills. Also it is a small function in my wider email build project that i am working towards.

## What level of react am I?

I've just started to learn react so this is a good teacher. I was stuck in tutorial H and had to move into just build what I want to build mentality.

## Who will use this?

This is a basic app, it allows people to make buttons and embed them into emails.
I can see marketers who want a cool UI when building buttons
